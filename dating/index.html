      <p class="mb-4">Thanks for dropping by :)</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">Rather than locking my dating profile inside a specific app, I thought I'd harness the power of the internet and put it out here for all to see.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">If you're not a single lady, I'd very much love if you shared this with the women in your life who you can't believe are still single.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">If you're an awesome woman yourself, please take a gander and reach out if you think we could be a match! My contact info is at the bottom.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-text mb-6 mt-16">The basics</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">I'm 42, 6'4", and interested in women. I've never been
    married, but would like to change that. No kids yet, but very much want
    them. I'm ethnically Jewish (50% Ashkenazi!) and love the culture, but I wasn't raised
    with any religion and don't practice any now.</p>

    <p class="mb-8">My home is in Somerville, MA and I'm pretty planted here.
    Last year, I bought a lake house with my family! We're there almost every
    weekend in the summer, and it's made our already-close relationships even stronger.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-text mb-6 mt-16">About my life</h2>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-text mb-4 mt-8">Family</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">I won the family lottery. It's almost certainly the best thing about my life.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I have a younger brother who lives nearby and is one of my favorite people. He's married with a young son and daughter. I knew I would enjoy being an uncle, but I'm liking it even more than expected. I almost can't talk about my niece and nephew without smiling.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">My parents also live nearby. My mom is smart and warm, and my dad is ridiculously handy and protective of his people.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-text mb-4 mt-8">Work</h3>
    <p class="mb-6">I'm the co-founder of <a href="https://tuple.app"
      class="text-primary hover:text-accent underline decoration-1
      underline-offset-2">a software company</a> I started in 2018 with two
    friends. Thanks to some good decisions and even better luck, it's gone
    super well. This year, my co-founders and I put new leaders in place and
    stepped away from day-to-day operations. I don't currently need a day-job,
    so I spend most of my time pursuing passion projects. Lately, I've
      been getting rather involved in local politics, and am attempting to grow <a
    href="https://fractal.boston" class="text-primary hover:text-accent
  underline decoration-1 underline-offset-2">a new community</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-text mb-4 mt-8">Singing</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">One of the things that brings me the most joy in life is singing.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I was fortunate to be raised by musical parents who encouraged me to join choruses at an early age. Thanks to them, I've been singing in some ensemble or another for ~30 years.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Currently, I sing with the Tanglewood Festival Choir, which performs with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Before that, I sang in a barbershop quartet for 10 years alongside my brother. I miss that group a lot and hope to start a new quartet someday.</p>
    <p class="mb-6">I've had so many rich experiences in those groups, and I'd love to tell you about them in person.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-text mb-4 mt-8">Fitness</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">Even when it's a pain, I'm pretty good about making myself exercise regularly.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">It's worth it to me for a few reasons:</p>
    <ul class="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
      <li>Living is awesome and I want to do it for a long time!</li>
      <li>I want to be a bad-ass old dude who can occasionally embarrass the younger guys.</li>
      <li>It makes my moods dramatically better. I'm more fun to be around when I'm exercising.</li>
      <li>Little bit of vanity, tbh.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-8">I tend to bounce between fitness activities. I get super into something for a while and then change it up. Right now it's lifting and yoga, but previous stints have included volleyball, boxing, and ultimate.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-text mb-6 mt-16">What I'm looking for</h2>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-text mb-4 mt-8">Important stuff</h3>
    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>You're emotionally warm and have nurturer energy. You have a ton of love to give, and are exciting about receiving it as well (I am extremely affectionate and always have been).</li>
      <li>You think we'd be good at making each other laugh. I think I value having a funny partner way more than most men. I've found it makes life <em>so</em> much more enjoyable. I love quick-wittedness and callbacks. These days, I most enjoy the comedy of Mike Birbiglia, Shane Gillis, Tom Segura, and Bo Burnham.</li>
      <li>You're excited to raise happy kids in not too many years (after dating, marriage, and at least one serious adventure).
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>It's very important to me to eventually be a father, but I'm somewhat flexible on how I achieve this. In order, starting with most appealing, my preferences are: have biological kids with my partner, have biological kids via a surrogate, or adopt.</li>
          <li>I'm open to dating people with kids if you're open to having more (or to me attempting to have a child via surrogacy and raising him/her together).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You're willing to living near Boston
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>I very much want to live near my family most of the time. Also: lake house.</li>
          <li>If there's a part of the world that's important to you to live near, I'm down to live there some of the year!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You take your health seriously. Personally, I plan to never die. It's fine if you do, but only after a good long bit.</li>
      <li>You tend to focus on what's good in the world. You're not afraid to confront life's challenges, but do so from a place of optimism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-text mb-4 mt-8">Non-essential bonuses</h3>
    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>You have a good memory and are detail-oriented (these are a weakness for me, so it'd be rad if I could lean on you a bit here).</li>
      <li>You make things happen in the world.
        <ul class="list-circle pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>What are your schemes? How can I help? Will you help me with mine?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You have a great relationship with your family.</li>
      <li>You have a little bit of a mischievous side.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium text-text mb-4 mt-8">Things I do/believe that may or may not work for you</h3>
    <ul class="mb-8 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>I am socially liberal, but my economic views lean libertarian. I tend to think that capitalism and free markets are usually (though not always!) produce better outcomes than their alternatives.</li>
      <li>I'm a bit allergic to people using astrology as a truth-finding tool.</li>
      <li>The in-practice replacement of iced coffee with cold brew was a crime and rises to the level of iced coffee erasure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8">If you do reach out, please don't feel like you ought to write as much as I have. That said, I'd love it if you did include at least some basics and a few photos. If you have links to online presences that I can check out, that'd be great too.</p>
    <p class="mb-8">Hope to hear from you soon! :)</p>
