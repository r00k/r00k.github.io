<h1 class="headline centered">My Newsletter</h1>

<p>Not much makes me happier than helping other people learn useful things.</p>

<p>Do you want to get better at any of these?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Starting and running a software business</li>
  <li>Personal productivity</li>
</ul>

<p>If so, you'll probably enjoy my newsletter. It's decidedly low-volume; maybe an email every month or so.</p>

<p>[Defunct now, I'm afraid! Your best bet these days for my thoughts is to <a href="http://twitter.com/r00k">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>
